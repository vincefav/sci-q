Sequence-to-sequence deep learning to answer science questions (WIP)

**About the dataset**
The dataset consists of 11,679 multiple-choice science questions. For each question, the correct answer and 3 incorrect answers are provided, but we'll only be using the correct answers to train the model.

Still a work in progress. The model almost certainly won't be that impressive (it needs even more training data!), but I'm curious to see how well Seq2Seq model can learn from the training data.
